# rock-paper-scissors
A classic Rock Paper Scissors game in the browser!

Here are some things I learned and utlized in this project:

- Destructuring: This was an absolutely crucial step for me as I was having trouble passing the updated scores of the computer or the user to the main function. I used this within a loop in order to keep the updated value within the for loop for easy access to the next iteration. - since has been refactored when I made a UI
- Functional Programming: My aim from the start of this project was to put everything into a function to truly focus on functional programming best practices. 
- CSS Grid for the UI
