# rock-paper-scissors
A classic Rock Paper Scissors game in the console (for the time being)! Looking forward to adding a UI eventually. 

Thankful I was able to participate in this challenge. Here are some things I learned and utlized in this project:

- Destructuring: This was an absolutely crucial step for me as I was having trouble passing the updated scores of the computer or the user to the main function. I used this within a loop in order to keep the updated value within the for loop for easy access to the next iteration. 
- Return Statements: Return statements were a little tricky based on the way I structured my code, but MDN and Google cleared up some confusion on my part. 
- Functional Programming: My aim from the start of this project was to put everything into a function to truly focus on functional programming best practices.
